# Lab 07: Migrating Hyper-V VMs to Azure by using Azure Migrate

## Lab scenario

Despite its ambitions to modernize its workloads as part of the migration to Azure, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team realizes that, due to aggressive timelines, in many cases, it will be necessary to follow the lift-and-shift approach. To simplify this task, the team starts exploring the capabilities of Azure Migrate. Azure Migrate serves as a centralized hub to assess and migrate to Azure on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data.

Azure Migrate provides the following features:

- Unified migration platform: A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
- Range of tools: A range of tools for assessment and migration. Tools include Azure Migrate: Server Assessment and Migration and modernization. Azure Migrate integrates with other Azure services and with other tools and independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
- Assessment and migration: In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate:
    - Servers: Assess on-premises servers and migrate them to Azure virtual machines.
    - Databases: Assess on-premises databases and migrate them to Azure SQL Database or to SQL Managed Instance.
    - Web applications: Assess on-premises web applications and migrate them to Azure App Service by using the Azure App Service Migration Assistant.
    - Virtual desktops: Assess your on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure.
    - Data: Migrate large amounts of data to Azure quickly and cost-effectively using Azure Data Box products.

While databases, web apps, and virtual desktops are within the scope of the next stage of the migration initiative, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team wants to start by evaluating the use of Azure Migrate for migrating their on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines to Azure VM.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Migrating%20Hyper-V%20VMs%20to%20Azure%20by%20using%20Azure%20Migrate)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Lab Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Prepare for assessment and migration by using Azure Migrate.
-  Assess Hyper-V for migration by using Azure Migrate.
-  Migrate Hyper-V VMs by using Azure Migrate.

## Estimated Time: 180 minutes

## Exercise 1: Prepare the lab environment

In this exercise, you'll prepare the lab environment for performing migrations using Azure Migrate. You'll deploy a Hyper-V host inside an Azure VM using a nested virtualization setup, which will serve as your source environment for migration scenarios.

### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template

In this task, you deploy an Azure VM using the 301-nested-vms-in-virtual-network QuickStart template, configure necessary network settings, and enable RDP access with a public IP address.

1. On **Lab-VM**, start **Microsoft Edge (1)**, right click on the link **[301-nested-vms-in-virtual-network Azure QuickStart template](https://github.com/az140mp/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/demos/nested-vms-in-virtual-network)**, then **Copy link**, then paste it over the browser **(2)** and select **Deploy to Azure (3)**. (You'll find the button **Deploy to Azure** in the `README.md` file after the list of resources created by the template.) This will automatically redirect the browser to the **Hyper-V Host Virtual Machine with nested VMs** page in the Azure portal.

## Exercise 2: Prepare for assessment and migration by using Azure Migrate

In this exercise, you will prepare both the source Hyper-V environment and the target Azure infrastructure required for assessing and migrating on-premises virtual machines to Azure.
  
### Task 1: Configure Hyper-V environment

In this task, you configure the Hyper-V environment on the az801l07a-hv-vm by downloading and running the Azure Migrate PowerShell script, which checks system prerequisites, enables required services, and prepares the host for communication with Azure Migrate.

1. Navigate back to Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm** and within the Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm**, in the browser window change download location to **Downloads**.

    ![](../media/azm7-59.png)

     >**Note**: Refer the steps in Exercise 1-> Task 2-> Step 21 to change the location to **Downloads** folder.

1. Right click on [https://aka.ms/migrate/script/hyperv](https://aka.ms/migrate/script/hyperv), select **Copy link**, then paste it over the browser tab and download the Azure Migrate configuration PowerShell script.

    >**Note**: The script performs the following tasks:

    >- Checks that you're running the script on a supported PowerShell version
    >- Verifies that you have administrative privileges on the Hyper-V host
    >- Allows you to create a local user account that the Azure Migrate service uses to communicate with the Hyper-V host (This user account is added to **Remote Management Users**, **Hyper-V Administrators**, and **Performance Monitor Users** groups on the Hyper-V host.) 
    >- Checks that the host is running a supported version of Hyper-V, and the Hyper-V role
    >- Enables the WinRM service, and opens ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS) on the host (This is required for metadata collection.) 
    >- Enables PowerShell remoting on the host
    >- Checks that the Hyper-V Integration Services is enabled on all VMs managed by the host
    >- Enables CredSSP on the host if needed

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm**, search for **Windows PowerShell ISE (1)** then right click on **Windows PowerShell ISE** and then **Run as Administrator (2)**.

    ![](../media/azm7-60.png)

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, on the console pane, run the following commands to copy the script to the **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab07** folder and remove the Zone.Identifier alternate data stream, which, in this case, indicates that the file was downloaded from the Internet:

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path C:\Labfiles\Lab07 -Force
    Copy-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\MicrosoftAzureMigrate-Hyper-V.ps1" -Destination 'C:\Labfiles\Lab07'
    Unblock-File -Path C:\Labfiles\Lab07\MicrosoftAzureMigrate-Hyper-V.ps1
    Set-Location -Path C:\Labfiles\Lab07
    ```

     ![](../media/azm7-61.png)

1. Again open the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window as an **Administrator**.

1. Click on **File (1)** then **Open (2)**.

    ![](../media/azm7-62.png)

1. Navigate to **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab07 (1)** folder, select  **MicrosoftAzureMigrate-Hyper-V.ps1 (2)** script and click on **Open (3)**.

    ![](../media/azm7-63.png)

1. Select **Run**. 

    ![](../media/azm7-64.png)

1. When prompted for confirmation, enter **Y** and press Enter, **with the exception of the following prompts**, in which case, enter **N** and press Enter:
    
    - Do you use SMB share(s) to store the VHDs?
    - Do you want to create non-administrator local user for Azure Migrate and Hyper-V Host communication? 

      ![](../media/az801lab7img26.png)

### Task 2: Create an Azure Migrate project

In this task, you create an Azure Migrate project by logging into the Azure portal.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm**, in the browser window, go to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, and sign in by using the following credentials.

    - Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
  
    - Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

      >**Note**: If prompted, enter the code in Authenticator app to login
    
1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box, on the toolbar, search for **Azure Migrate (1)** and select **Azure Migrate (2)**.

    ![](../media/azm7-65.png)
