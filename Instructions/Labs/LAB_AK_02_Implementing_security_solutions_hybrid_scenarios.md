   ![](../Media/azm2-8.png) 

1. On the **Settings \| Defender plans (1)** page, select **Enable all plans (2)**. In the **Plan selection** page, select **Microsoft Defender for APIs Plan 1 (3)**, and then select **Save (4)**.

   ![](../Media/p5.png) 

1. In the **Settings | Defender plans** page, select **Save**.

   ![](../Media/p6.png) 

   >**Note:**  You may encounter notifications about auto-provisioning update failures. You can safely ignore these notifications, as you will only use the Servers plan in this lab. Note that you can selectively disable individual Microsoft Defender plans listed on the same page.

1. Set all of the plans to **Off (2)** except for the **Servers (1)** and select **Save (3)**. 

    >**Note:**  When presented with the **Resource types selection** for the Databases plan, toggle each entry to **Off** and then select **Continue**. For this lab, you can safely ignore any notifications about individual database resources failing to save.

    ![](../Media/p7.png) 

1. Select **Confirm** when asked if you are sure you want to **downgrade**.    

    ![](../Media/p8.png) 

1. Navigate to **Settings & monitoring** tab from the top menu.

    ![](../Media/azm2-9.png) 

1. On the **Settings & monitoring** tab, in the list of extensions, set **Vulnerability assessment for machines** to **On**.

    ![](../Media/azm2-10.png) 

1. On the **Extension deployment configuration** page, select **Apply**.

    ![](../Media/azm2-11.png) 

1. Select the **Edit configuration** link.

    ![](../Media/azm2-12.png)

1. On the **Extension deployment configuration** page, ensure that the **Microsoft Defender vulnerability management (1)** option is selected, and then select **Apply (2)**.

   ![](../Media/p10.png)    

1. On the **Settings & monitoring** tab, and in the list of extensions, set **Guest Configuration agent (preview)** to **On**.

    ![](../Media/azm2-13.png) 

1. On the **Settings & monitoring** page, select **Continue**.  

   ![](../Media/p11.png) 
 
1. On the **Defender plan** page, select **Save** and then close the page.

   ![](../Media/p6.png)

1. On the **Settings \| Defender plans** page, enable the **Servers (1)** Defender plan, and then select **Save (2)**.

   ![](../Media/p13.png) 

   >**Note:**  To enable all Defender for Cloud features, including threat protection capabilities, you must enable enhanced security features on the subscription containing the applicable workloads. Enabling it at the workspace level doesn't enable just-in-time VM access, adaptive application controls, and network detections for Azure resources. In addition, the only Microsoft Defender plans available at the workspace level are Microsoft Defender for servers and Microsoft Defender for SQL servers on machines.

1. On the **Settings \| Defender plans** page, in the vertical menu on the left side, in the **Settings** section, select **Data collection (1)**, then select **All Events (2)**, and then select **Save (3)**.

   ![](../Media/p14.png) 

   >**Note:**  Selecting a data collection tier in Defender for Cloud only affects the storage of security events in your Log Analytics workspace. The Log Analytics agent will still collect and analyze the security events required for Defender for Cloud's threat protection, regardless of the level of security events you choose to store in your workspace. Choosing to store security events enables investigation, search, and auditing of those events in your workspace.

## Exercise 3: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server
