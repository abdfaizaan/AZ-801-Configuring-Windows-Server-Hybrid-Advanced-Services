# Lab 03: Implementing failover clustering

## Lab Scenario

As the business of Contoso, Ltd. grows, it's becoming increasingly important that many of the applications and services on its network are always available. Contoso has many services and applications that must be available to internal and external users who work in different time zones around the world. Many of these applications can't be made highly available by using Network Load Balancing (NLB). Therefore, you should use a different technology to make these applications highly available.

As one of the senior network administrators at Contoso, you're responsible for implementing failover clustering on the servers that are running Windows Server to provide high availability for network services and applications. You're also responsible for planning the failover cluster configuration and deploying applications and services on the failover cluster.


## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you'll be working on:

- Exercise 1: Configuring iSCSI Storage.
- Exercise 2: Configuring a Failover Cluster.
- Exercise 3: Deploying and Configuring a Highly Available File Server.
- Exercise 4: Validating the Deployment of the Highly Available File Server.

## Estimated time: **80 minutes**

## Exercise 1: Configuring iSCSI storage

In this exercise, you will be configuring iSCSI storage to be used in a failover cluster environment. You will install necessary features and roles, configure virtual disks, and initiate connections from two servers.

### Task 1: Install Failover Clustering

In this task, you will be installing the Failover Clustering feature and management tools on two servers (SEA-SVR1 and SEA-SVR2) and installing the iSCSI Target server role on SEA-DC1 using PowerShell commands.

1. Connect to **SEA-SVR2**, and then, if needed, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, select **Start**, and right-click on **Windows PowerShell**, and select **Run as administrator**.

1. To install the Failover Clustering server feature including the management tools on **SEA-SVR1** and **SEA-SVR2**, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following commands, and after entering each command, press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools
   Install-WindowsFeature -ComputerName 'SEA-SVR1.contoso.com' -Name Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools
   ```

   > **Note**: Wait for the installation process to complete. The installation should take about 1 minute.

1. To install iSCSI Target server role service on **SEA-DC1**, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature -ComputerName 'SEA-DC1.contoso.com' -Name FS-iSCSITarget-Server -IncludeManagementTools
   ```

   > **Note**: Wait for the installation process to complete. The installation should take about 1 minute.

1. Minimize the Windows Powershell window.

### Task 2: Configure iSCSI virtual disks

In this task, you will be creating iSCSI virtual disks on SEA-DC1. This includes establishing PowerShell Remoting sessions to SEA-DC1 and SEA-SVR1, starting the iSCSI Initiator service on both SEA-SVR1 and SEA-SVR2, and creating the iSCSI Target on SEA-DC1.

>**Important:** The lab uses **SEA-DC1**, which serves as an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controller to host shared iSCI storage for a Windows Server-based cluster. This is not meant to represent in any way a recommended configuration but rather is done to simplify the lab configuration and minimize the number of lab virtual machines. In any production environment, domain controllers should not be used to host shared storage for failover clusters. Instead, such storage should be hosted on highly available infrastructure. 

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, select **Start**, and right-click on **Windows PowerShell**, and select **Run as administrator** to start a new session.

1. To establish a PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-DC1**, in the newly opened **Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName SEA-DC1.contoso.com
   ```

1. To create iSCSI virtual disks on **SEA-DC1**, on **SEA-SVR2**, in the PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-DC1**, enter the following commands, and after entering each command, press Enter:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory C:\Storage -Force
   ```
   ```powershell
   New-IscsiVirtualDisk C:\Storage\disk1.VHDX -size 10GB
   ```
   ```powershell
   New-IscsiVirtualDisk C:\Storage\disk2.VHDX -size 10GB
   ```
   ```powershell
   New-IscsiVirtualDisk C:\Storage\disk3.VHDX -size 10GB
   ```
1. Minimize the Windows Powershell window.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, select **Start**, and right-click on **Windows PowerShell**, and select **Run as administrator** to start a new session.

1. To establish a PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-SVR1**, in the newly opened **Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName SEA-SVR1.contoso.com
   ```

   > **Note:** At this point, you should have three **Windows PowerShell** windows opened. You will use the first one to run commands locally on **SEA-SVR2**, while using the other two to interact with **SEA-DC1** and **SEA-SVR1**. You can easily recognize each of them by identifying the PowerShell prompt (for the second and third one, the prompt will contain **[SEA-DC1.contoso.com]** and **[SEA-SVR1.contoso.com]** prefix, respectively).

1. To start the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator service on **SEA-SVR2**, at the **Windows PowerShell** prompt providing access to the local session, enter the following commands, and after entering each command, press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-Service -ServiceName MSiSCSI
   Set-Service -ServiceName MSiSCSI -StartupType Automatic
   ```

1. To start the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator service on **SEA-SVR1**, switch to the **Windows PowerShell** window hosting PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-SVR1**, enter the following commands, and after entering each command, press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-Service -ServiceName MSiSCSI
   Set-Service -ServiceName MSiSCSI -StartupType Automatic
   ```

1. To create the Microsoft iSCSI Target on **SEA-DC1**, switch to the **Windows PowerShell** window hosting PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-DC1**, enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   New-IscsiServerTarget -TargetName iSCSI-L03 -InitiatorIds IQN:iqn.1991-05.com.microsoft:sea-svr1.contoso.com,IQN:iqn.1991-05.com.microsoft:sea-svr2.contoso.com
   ```
